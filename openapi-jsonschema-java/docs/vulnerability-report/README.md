# Vulnerability Reports

This directory contains security vulnerability reports generated by OWASP Dependency Check during Maven builds.

## Report Types

The following report formats are generated:

- **HTML Report** (`dependency-check-report.html`): Human-readable web report with detailed vulnerability information
- **JSON Report** (`dependency-check-report.json`): Machine-readable JSON format for integration with other tools
- **XML Report** (`dependency-check-report.xml`): XML format for parsing and integration
- **CSV Report** (`dependency-check-report.csv`): Spreadsheet-compatible format for analysis

## Timestamped Reports

Each Maven build creates timestamped copies of all reports with the format:
- `dependency-check-report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.{html,json,xml,csv}`
- `scan-summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt`: Summary information about the scan

## Running Vulnerability Scans

### Manual Scan
```bash
# Run vulnerability check only
mvn org.owasp:dependency-check-maven:check

# Run full verify phase (includes vulnerability check)
mvn clean verify
```

### Build Integration
Vulnerability scanning is automatically included in the `verify` phase of the Maven build lifecycle:

```bash
# Standard build with vulnerability scanning
mvn clean install

# Full verification including tests and security scan
mvn clean verify
```

## Configuration

The vulnerability scanner is configured in `pom.xml` with the following settings:

- **Fail Threshold**: CVSS score â‰¥ 7.0 will fail the build
- **Output Directory**: `docs/vulnerability-report/`
- **Formats**: ALL (HTML, JSON, XML, CSV)
- **Suppression File**: `dependency-check-suppressions.xml`

## Suppressing False Positives

False positives can be suppressed by adding entries to `dependency-check-suppressions.xml` in the project root.

Example suppression:
```xml
<suppress>
    <notes><![CDATA[
    Suppression reason for CVE-XXXX-XXXX
    ]]></notes>
    <packageUrl regex="true">^pkg:maven/group\.id/artifact\-id@.*$</packageUrl>
    <cve>CVE-XXXX-XXXX</cve>
</suppress>
```

## Report Retention

- Latest reports overwrite previous versions
- Timestamped copies are preserved for historical tracking
- Consider implementing cleanup policies for old timestamped reports

## Integration with CI/CD

These reports can be integrated with CI/CD pipelines:

1. **Parse JSON reports** for automated vulnerability analysis
2. **Archive timestamped reports** as build artifacts
3. **Set build failure policies** based on CVSS scores
4. **Generate notifications** for newly discovered vulnerabilities
