**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Incremental implementation with validation against JSON Schema test suite
- Early proof-of-concept for complex features
- Regular validation with specification authors/community
- Fallback to Draft 2019-09 for non-critical features if needed

**Timeline Impact**: +1 week buffer in Phase 2
**Contingency Plan**: Implement Draft 2019-09 support first, upgrade to 2020-12 incrementally

#### Risk 2: Performance Requirements
**Impact**: High - Performance below targets could limit adoption
**Probability**: Medium - Large document processing and concurrent usage are challenging
**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Performance testing from Sprint 2 onwards
- Streaming algorithms for large documents
- Memory profiling and optimization throughout development
- Load testing with realistic data volumes

**Timeline Impact**: Ongoing performance focus, +1 week in Phase 2 if needed
**Contingency Plan**: Implement tiered performance modes (fast/comprehensive)

#### Risk 3: Third-Party Library Dependencies
**Impact**: Medium - Bugs or breaking changes in dependencies
**Probability**: Low - Using well-maintained, stable libraries
**Mitigation Strategy**:
- Pin specific versions and test thoroughly
