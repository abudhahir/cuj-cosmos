# Sprint 2 Summary – OpenAPI Processing Foundation (Phase 1)

Status: Completed (Weeks 3–4)

## Highlights
- Integrated OpenAPI 3.0+ parser (Swagger Parser 2.1.33)
- Extracted component schemas with $ref dereferencing
- Introduced caching abstraction and initial Caffeine-backed implementation
- Enabled multi-spec registration via Spring Boot properties `cosmos.openapi.specs[*]`
- Added unit tests with sample specifications (including external references)
- Introduced configuration to control reference handling:
  - `cosmos.schema.inline-refs` (default `false`)
    - `false`: Prefer `$ref: #/$defs/...` with centralized `$defs`
    - `true`: Inline referenced components

## Artifacts & Code
- Branch: `feature/phase1-sprint2-openapi`
- README updated with Sprint 2 deliverables and properties
- Tests covering parser configuration, extraction, and ref handling

## Acceptance
- Local build passes with quality gates: `mvn clean verify`
- CI pipelines configured to enforce style, static analysis, and coverage

## Notes
- Branch protection remains an administrative task outside the repository code
- Further caching strategies (e.g., Redis) to be considered in later phases

## Next Up (Sprint 3 – JSON Schema Generation)
- OpenAPI → JSON Schema Draft 2020-12 converter
- POJO → JSON Schema generator (VicTools) with module configuration
- Validation wiring (NetworkNT) and golden-schema tests
